1. Start by acquiring a baseline measurement of performance and defining indicators of reliable performance for each endpoint. Prioritize these endpoints and implement tests and monitoring for the most important ones first.

2. Define the parameters that are needed for each test (i.e. how many requests, over what time period, at what time of day). For example, high concurrency over a short amount of time will have different results than lower concurrency and a longer/heavier overall load. What is the upper limit of each endpoint's capabilitly before performance suffers? If the system crashes, was data saved?

3. For stress tests, design and test for sudden usage spikes that exceed current capabilities (a sudden influx of signups, for example). This relies on aforementioned historical data and monitoring.
