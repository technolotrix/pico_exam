Instructions for running the suite:

Uses python3.9 and packages can be installed using requirements.txt
    `python -m pip install requirements.txt`

To change the URL used for performance tests, edit
    `/config/performance_settings.sh`

1. Download the Chromedriver binary and include it in your PATH
    `https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads`
    Otherwise, you can update config/settings.py to use firefox (lowercase string)

2. Do the following steps to set up your environment
    `alias python=python3`
    `python -m venv qa_dev`
    `source qa_dev/bin/activate`
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run tests from the root directory of the project:
    Tests are expected to fail until `next` button can be clicked correctly in Selenium

Selenium tests:
`nosetests -vs tests/ui/`

Performance test and plot:
`bash tests/performance/performance.sh`

Plot only:
`python libs/histogram.py {full/path/to/file}`
