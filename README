Instructions for running the suite:

Uses python3.9 and packages can be installed using requirements.txt
    `python -m pip install requirements.txt`

To change the URL used for performance tests, edit
    `/config/performance_settings.sh`

1. Download the Chromedriver binary and include it in your PATH
    `https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads`
    Otherwise, you can update config/settings.py to use firefox (lowercase string)

2. Run `setup.sh` from the root directory of this folder
    The script will create and activate a virtual env, install packages, and run the tests. Alternatively, you can manually run tests from the root directory of the project:

Selenium tests:
`nosetests -vs tests/ui/`

Performance test and plot:
`bash tests/performance/performance.sh`

Plot only:
`python libs/histogram.py {full/path/to/file}`
